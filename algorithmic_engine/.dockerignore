# Add other files/directories if they shouldn't be in the image
# For example, if .env contains secrets not for the image, handle it via docker-compose env vars
# However, for SQLite DATABASE_URL, it's often fine in .env if it's just a path.
# .env # Uncomment if you want to exclude .env from the Docker image build context
# sql_app.db # Exclude if you want the DB to be initialized fresh or only live in a volume
